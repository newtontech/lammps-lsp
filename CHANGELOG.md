# LAMMPS LSP Changelog

## [0.1.0-pre.4] - Unreleased

### Added

- A locked cargo-dist artifact contract for macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel),
  Linux x86_64, and Windows x86_64 archives.
- GitHub Release installers, SHA-256 sidecars, and pre-upload artifact
  verification.
- Release smoke coverage for the server commands, agent CLI, valid and invalid
  LAMMPS inputs, and LAMMPS error logs.

### Changed

- The authoritative package identity is now `lammps-lsp` in the
  `newtontech/lammps-lsp` repository.
- `lammps-analyser`, `lammps-lsp`, `lammps-lsp-tool`, and the legacy `lmp-lsp`
  alias report the same `0.1.0-pre.4` version.
- The agent capability response embeds package and candidate-release provenance,
  including when the executable is used outside a source checkout.

### Distribution

- This prerelease is GitHub Release only. Publishing to crates.io is explicitly
  outside the scope of `0.1.0-pre.4`.
- The release workflow and artifact lock prepare tag `v0.1.0-pre.4`; this entry
  remains unreleased until that tag is intentionally created after merge.

## Initial Release 0.1.0

### Features

- A cli `lammps-analyser` that checks input scripts
- A language server `lmp-lsp` that performs these checks within the text editor.
- Supported checks:
  - Warnings about unused variables
  - Errors if variables/fixes/computes are used but not defined.
  - Commands have valid names
  - That fix/compute/pair styles are valid.
  - The number of arguments for fix and compute commands.
  - Fully checks arguments for the npt/nph/npt fixes.
  - Warns if computes fixes or variables have been defined multiple times before a `run` command. 
- The LSP provides:
  - Go-to definition and references for variables, computes and fixes.
  - Hover documentation for commands, fixes and computes.
  - Checks your script as you type and reports errors and warnings 
- Based of LAMMPS 27June2024 Feature Release

### Internal Features

- Scripts to convert LAMMPS documentation files to Markdown and extract `fix`,`pair` and `compute` styles
- A parser that converts a `tree-sitter` tree of the script into an abstract syntax tree.
